We use renet18 (fined tuning) to recognise the hand drawing images
The data is given by Quick, Draw! dataset made by Google: https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap;tab=objects?pageState=(%22StorageObjectListTable%22:(%22f%22:%22%255B%255D%22))&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false&inv=1&invt=AbrzMQ
